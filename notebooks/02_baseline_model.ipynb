    "# Baseline AML Risk Modeling\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook consolidates all engineered features into a **baseline AML risk model**, focusing on ranking performance under extreme class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inputs\n",
    "- Consolidated customer feature table\n",
    "- `labels.csv` (partial supervision)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs\n",
    "- Train / validation splits\n",
    "- Logistic Regression, KNN, tree-based baselines\n",
    "- ROC-AUC, PR-AUC metrics\n",
    "- Customer-level risk scores\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "- Establish a reproducible AML baseline\n",
    "- Validate usefulness of rule-derived features\n",
    "- Produce analyst-ready risk rankings\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "- Precision is expected to be low\n",
    "- Ranking and explainability are primary objectives\n"
